# Neon-Trigger
This is my project for my final year at university which is supervised Marius Varga

## What is Neon Trigger?
Neon Trigger is a top-down shooter, that is themed around the sci-fi world and has a low-poly aesthetic. Players control a robot that has the ability to shoot 2 different types of bullets, those bullets deal extra damamage to the enemies of the opposite colour (Red bullets deal extra damage to blue enemies and blue bullets deal extra damage to red enemies). The player also has a dash to help them avoid enemy projectiles.
